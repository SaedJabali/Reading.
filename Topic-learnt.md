## What is GitHub ?
**GitHub** is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management **(SCM)** functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

To write in GitHub you need to use a language called Markdown **(the one used it in this article)**.

__Markdown__ is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

Using __Markdown__ is different than using a __WYSIWYG__ editor. In an application like _Microsoft Word_, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are __visible immediately__. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add __Markdown syntax__ to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

There are many reasons why markdown is used instead of WYSIWYG editors.
* Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
* Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
* Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

Here some examples for basic writing and formatting syntax Markdown
