# Forms

Since form elements naturally hold some internal state, they behave a little *differently* in **React** than other DOM elements.

When a user submits a form, the form's default HTML form action is to navigate to a new tab. It simply functions in *React* if you like this action. However, in most cases, using a JavaScript feature that manages form entry and has access to the data entered by the user is more convenient. A methodology known as "**controlled components**" is often used to do this.

# The Conditional

Beginning with the Fundamentals â€” The If Argument When we have a clause, such as an if sentence, we will determine that a certain block of code should be executed if a specific condition is reached.

Instead of longer if and else conditional sentences, use the ternary operator to make decisions. There are three arguments to the ternary operator: The first point is based on a distinction. The product of a true analogy is the second. and to make the coding easier to read.

**Normal If Argument**

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

**Operator Conditional**

 console.log((x===y)? true : false);
