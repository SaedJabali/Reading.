# What is the hardest thing about writing code?

*Understanding* The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming.

There are many ways to make it easier such as, learning a new technology,
naming things and testing your code

#### A familiar problem

When someone *starting* to learn something new they should not start *big* and learn all the material in a *single* day or do an advanced things also, the best way to learn is start *samll* and then improve and one of the ways to to start good is to start with a simple code or an easy one so that anyone can understand it without any difficulties to make coding or the structure of the language easy enough and can be learnd. 


## What is an object?

**Objects** group together a *set of variables and functions to create a model*
of a something you would **recognize** from the real world.
In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
If a **variable** is part of an object, it is called a
**property**. Properties te ll us about the object.

IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS
If a **function** is part of an object, it is called a **method**.
Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object.

#### Object Literal.

A JavaScript *object literal* is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.
 Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package.
  This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

The following demonstrates an example object literal:

let myObject = {

    sProp: 'some string value',

    numProp: 2,

    bProp: false

}

Object literal property *values* can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, and nested object literals.

#### Object Literal Syntax

Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:

A **colon** separates property name from value.
A **comma** separates each name-value pair from the next.
A **comma** after the last name-value pair is optional.


### Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
And it is language-independent.
