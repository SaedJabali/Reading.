# State and Props

## State and Lifecycle

What is a State in React?

Property values for the component are stored in the state entity. The item is re-rendered as the state object shifts.

What is a Lifecycle in React?

During the three key stages, we can track and control the lifecycle. Mounting, updating, and unmounting are the three stages.

## Handling Events

Using React elements to handle events is somewhat close to using *DOM* elements. There are some variations in syntax: **CamelCase** is used to call React occurrences instead of lowercase.
Instead of passing a string as the event handler, JSX allows us to pass a method.

## Conditional Rendering

In React, we can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior we need. Then, we can render only some of them, depending on the state of our application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

## The Spread Operator

JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

Spread syntax can be used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in a list of some kind.

The spread syntax “spreads” the array into separate arguments.

In *JavaScript*, spread syntax refers to the use of an **ellipsis** of three dots (. . .) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
