__Css__ stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS allows us to create rules that _specify_ how the content of
an element should appear in addition it make web pages more __attractive__,
controlling the design of them.

Using CSS, you could add a _border_ around any of the boxes, specify its _width_ and _height_, or add a _background color_. You could also control text inside a box â€” for example, its color, size, and the typeface used.

### Things CSS can do

With _boxes_ can change Width and height Borders (color, width, and style) Background color and images Position in the browser window.

And with _texts_ can change Typeface Size Color Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase and small-caps.

<p style= color:green;background-color:lightblue> And with _texts_ can change Typeface Size Color Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase and small-caps. </p>

<style>
div {
  background-color: black;
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px lightblue;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
</style>

<div>
In the last two texts I used markdown and css languages, you can see the effect that css makes on texts.
