# Monetization

Means converting something into money. In practice, this means turning things into revenue-generating activities, services, or assets.

## Sell goods or services through your app
When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments: 

* Google Play's billing system.
* Google Pay.

### Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system

Use Google Play's billing system to sell digital goods or services within an app on Google Play.

Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

1. **Virtual game products**, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or 
   avatars, additional levels or playtime.
   
2. **App functionality or content**, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free 
   version.
   
3. **Subscription services**, such as streaming media, digital publications, and social networking services.

4. **Cloud software products**, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial 
   management software.
   
### Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay

Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside your app

1. **Retail merchandise**, such as groceries, clothing, housewares, and electronics.

2. **Physical services**, including taxi and transportation services, cleaning services, food delivery, airfare, and 
   event tickets.
   
3. **One-time membership fees or recurring dues**, including gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs offering 
accessories, clothing, or other physical products.
   
4. **Electronic bill payment**, including credit card bills, utilities, and cable or telecommunications services.

## Best practices for setting initial monetization strategy

1. **Research other apps in your category**: Learn how other developers charge for their apps and content.

2. **Think about how your app will be used**: Your app's usage patterns can indicate the best monetization choices.

3. **Make use of natural extensions**: If your app can be extended or expanded, such as with adding levels in a game, 
consider making the core app available for free and offering extended features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.
   
4. **Consider your cost structures**: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions.
   
5. **Consider your audience**: For some audiences, the scope for using advertising, subscriptions, or in-app purchases can be limited.

6. **Consider local factors when setting prices**: When setting prices for apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in 
specific markets, be sure to consider cost of living differences, local pricing patterns, pricing of competitive apps, and other market factors.

## Best practices for optimizing your monetization strategy
1. **Analyze statistics in the Google Play Console**: Gain an understanding of your users' purchasing patterns, 
   including statistics on average revenue per paying user and new versus returning buyers.
   
2. **Understand purchasing behavior with Google Analytics for Firebase**: With data on up to 500 in-app events, Google 
Analytics for Firebase can provide insights into user buying behavior.

3. **Run pricing experiments**: Use in-app A/B testing to experiment with different prices and alternative ways to 
encourage users to take up subscriptions or purchase in-app products.

4. **Offer a sale price**: Paid apps can use strikethrough pricing in the Play Console to offer a discounted price 
   for a limited time and encourage more purchases.
