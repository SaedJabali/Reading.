# OOP

## Objects

There are many examples to clarify objects in real world, almost everything is an object.

Objects we can say roughly are everything has a state and behavior, the state is the information it has and the behavior what it does(its mechanism).


Benefits of building an objects:

1. Modularity: The code of the object is independent from any other codes, we can write it as itself and then implement it in our code.

2. Information-hiding: The variables and the values inside an object will remain inside it and won't be visible.

3. Code re-use: We can use any object from any code if it serves my code.

4. Pluggability and debugging ease: We can replace an object with another one if we found any error in it.

## Classes

We can say that the class is a super set of objects, each object we create inside a class called instance and will have the same parameters as the calss.

If we built a class for a student we can consider it a template, a blueprint for any student/object, each student will have the same information or parameteres.

The class will only have information and each object will have these information.

In this way we can declare a class

class MyClass {
    // field, constructor, and
    // method declarations
}

everything inside the class will the information for the objects.
