# Relationships in Spring Data REST

There are three relathion :

1. ### (Many to One , One to Many)

This relationship refers to the relationship between two entities say A and B in which one element of A will be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A.

2. ### One to One

In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table.
