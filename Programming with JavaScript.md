## JavaScript

![Js](https://p1.hiclipart.com/preview/951/574/485/react-logo-javascript-redux-vuejs-angular-angularjs-expressjs-front-and-back-ends-png-clipart.jpg)

__JavaScript__ is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages while it is being viewed in the browser.


## Why we use Js.
* accesing content on html pages.
* Modifying content.
* Give the pages or programs rules. 
* Make the script react to events (react upon actions)

__Now__ we should know what script means so we can be more familiar with ths js language.

__*script*__ is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal,
but in case of browser it is different because the script depends on how the user interact.

If we want write a *script*, first of all we have to state what we need and then list the tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

This summarized in these steps
1. Define the goal. (what you need)
2. Design the script.
3. Code each step.


## Varibales and Arrays

There are **6** rules to name a variable
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must __not__ start with a number.

2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.

3. You __cannot__ use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
[See keywords and reserved words for Js](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp)

4. All variables are __case sensitive__, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, __firstName__ might be used to store a person's first name, __lastName__ for their last name, and __age__ for their age.

6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.For example, firstName rather than firstname (this is referred to as *camel case*). You can also use an underscore between each word (you __cannot__ use a dash).

## ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a __list__ of values.

For example, an array can be suited to storing the individual items on a shopping __list__ because it is a __list__ of related items.

You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var **keyword** followed by the name of the array) and this technique known as an **_array literal_**.

The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is __separated__ by a comma.
