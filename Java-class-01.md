## What does it mean to compile code?

Compiling is the *transformation* from Source Code (human readable) into **machine code** (computer executable). A compiler is a program. A compiler takes the recipe (code) for a new program (written in a high level language) and transforms this Code into a new language (Machine Language) that can be understood by the computer itself.
