# How computers work?

A __computer__ is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

Computer works upon this diagram where it takes information and processes it and then give the result as it should be.

This operation __makes__ computer a computer.

At first, computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears and was invented as a calculater.
__By__ the 20th century electrical components were used and the computers were so huge and takes too long to do a math problem.
 But nowadays computers are everywhere and with everyone they could be a laptop or a tablet or a phone, they just got into every aspects of life.

 **The input** is what user do or ask the computer to do using keyboard, mouse or touchscreen.

 ## The Binary number system

 In mathematics, positional numeral system employing 2 as the base and so requiring only two different symbols for its digits, __0 and 1__, instead of the usual 10 different symbols needed in the decimal system. The numbers from 0 to 10 are thus in binary 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, and 1010.

 We can write any number using the binary numbring system.

__The importance__ of the binary system to information theory and computer technology derives mainly from the compact and reliable manner in which 0s and 1s can be represented in electromechanical devices with two states—such as “on-off,” “open-closed,” or “go–no go.
