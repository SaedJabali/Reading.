## Operators and Loops

__Operators.__

Operators are the *symbols* which are used to perform certain operations on the data such as addition, subtraction and comparison etc, and most of them used with *decision* statements.


### Types of operators.

* Arithmetic operators

|  Operator	|  Description                                               |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| +	|Addition|
|-|	Subtraction|
|*|	Multiplication|
|/|	Division|
|%|	Modulus (remainder) ( e.g. 3%2 = 1)|
|++|	“Increment (e.g. if a = 1, then a++ = 2)”|
|–|	“Decrement (e.g. if a = 1, then a– = 0)”|
|+= -= *= /=|	short notation (e.g.’a += 3’ indicates ‘a = a+3’|


* Relational operators

|Condition|	Symbol|
|----------------------------|----------------|
|equal|	== | 
|not equal|	!= |
| greater|	> |
|smaller|	< |
| greater or equal |	>= |
|smaller or equal|	<= |


* Bitwise operators

|Operators|	Symbol|
|-----------------|-------------|
|AND|	& |
|XOR|	^ |
|NOT|	~ |
|Left Shift|	<< |
|Right Shift|	>> |

* Logical operators

|Operator|	Description|
|----------------|---------------|
|&&|	Logical AND operator|
| ! |	Logical NOT Operator |


## Loops

Loops are used to perform the operations __repetitively__

### Types of loops

* For loop 

*For loop* best used for conditions that specified with a certain numbers.

 For loop structure 

 for (initial;condition;update)
 {statement;
 }

 if the result __true__ it will give (return) the statement 
 and if it is __false__ it will _break_ the for loop.

* While loop 

While loop is best when we dont how many _iterations_ will a condition take.

While loop structure

initial 
while (condition)
{
statement
update; 
}

if the result __true__ it will give (return) the statement 
 and if it is __false__ it will _break_ the while loop.
