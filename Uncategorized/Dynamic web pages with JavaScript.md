## The Document object 

It is used to access and _change_ what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.
It has 3 main sections
**_PROPERTIES_**
Properties describe characteristics of the current web page (such as the t itle of the page).
**_METHODS_**
Methods perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser (such
as getting information from a specified element or
adding new content).
**_EVENTS_**
You can respond to events, such as a user clicking or tapping on an element.

We can say that almost every webpage has the same document objects and this will help programmars or students to navigate and edit the html code easily.

__It is very important to follow the Js and html syntax to write a decent code or to make a good webpage__
